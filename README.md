The Illustrator file has a grid that every page has. Use it. Create
artboard if you need to add a new page. The font-families being used
are:

* Headings: DIN Condensed
* Body:
    * Fira Sans
    * Fira Sans Light on all the pages
    * Fira Sans Regular on the Sponsorship slabs page


Use old-style numbers for numbers. These are available if you install
the free Fira Sans typeface. They are not available in the DIN Condensed
typeface provided by default on OSX and so the numbers in that typeface
are the normal ones.
